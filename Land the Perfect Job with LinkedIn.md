## Step 1: Explore
It’s important to know what specific job you want, otherwise looking for a variety of jobs can make you look indecisive or unserious when applying.

- Connect with people ^1d3d99
	- Search up your school, go to alumni page, can search people by title/key words, and see where people work
	- Connect and add note; first approach wanting to learn about their career and ask for a quick meeting; build network first and ask about opportunities later
		- Example
			> “Hi XXX, I am a fellow alumni of XXX and was thrilled to come across your profile. I am exploring a career path in XXX and would love to learn from your expertise. Any chance you even have 10 minutes for a quick Zoom chat?”
		- Networking is important because of the way recruiter searches work (refer to [[Land the Perfect Job with LinkedIn#^15a191|Step 2]])
	- Don’t use message feature, might need premium subscription

- Reach out using the 3 C’s (commonality, curiosity, call-to-action)
- Just need a few questions focused on learning about what a job is like
- Get a good understanding of what you are good at/like and what you don’t like

## Step 2: Position Yourself

^c25397

- Recruiters have a special search page to recruit people ^15a191
	- May use job title, specific skills, and keywords to search for people
	- Keywords are highlighted in their searches
	- Searches may be ordered by level of connection to recruiter
- Headline > Summary > Experience/Skills has extra weight in search results
	- Make sure to include keywords in these sections (keywords may be from job descriptions)
	- For Headline:
		- Include what you want your next job to be e.g., “Aspiring XXX”, “Future XXX”, “Seeking XXX Roles” in additional to current title
		- Make sure to include job titles that are closely aligned to show specific interest in that field
		- Example
			> Student at School | Marketer with a passion for branding, seeking marketing manager roles
	- For Summary:
		- Make it quick to read, recruiters go through a lot of emails/profiles
		- Start with a quick summary that makes recruiters want you along with key examples to support
			- Search page only shows first sentence by default
				- May want to include desired job title, industry, skills here (e.g., “As a passionate marketer, I’m thrilled to help nonprofits optimize their web presence for maximum visibility”)
		- End with key words to help w/ search and invitation to connect
		- Example
			> Experienced marketer with a track record of successful launches, including:
			> - Launching XYZ, driving 100K sales in the first year
			> - Point 2
			>
			> Specialties: Branding, Social Media, SEO
			> Looking for a Product Marketing Manager? Contact me at EMAIL.

	- For Experience/Skills:
		- Make sure to include resume bullet points
			- Bullets should have a clear outcome and should include key words
		- Add as many skills (limit is 50) to help with recruiter search
- Use [JobScan](https://www.jobscan.co/) to ensure you have keywords in your profile
	- Copy paste entire LinkedIn profile, and copy paste at least 1+ job descriptions on LinkedIn to see what could be improved
	- Limited to 2 free scans/month

```

- Add profile picture
	- Headshot (crop to head and shoulders) to let people know who you are (subconsciously will attract to profiles w/ a face)
	- Genuine smile, have those face dimples and wrinkles (people can detect fake ones)
	- Dress for desired culture (depends on workplace or field)

- Anyone can endorse you but it does not show up on the recruiter search
- You can ask people for recommendations, these *will* show up on the search
	- Quality > quantity (who recommends matters); key words also matter
	- May want to say that it doesn’t need to be a long recommendation, and bring up a specific skill to talk about, not about your personality
	- Example request message
		> Hi XXX, I am starting to apply for product management roles and would love to show hiring managers my experience in the field. Would you be open to writing a short recommendation on my behalf? If so feel free to share my experience leading the launch and sales I helped generate. Thank you so much for all your support!


- Look at other profiles for examples
- Can use [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) for banner images
- Consider featuring posts you’ve made, adding more details to profile sections/entries, include licenses, honors, volunteer work, etc.
- Follow companies and organizations, recruiters can search by who you follow/followed interests
- Consider changing your location to where you want to work (since recruiters may filter based on location)

## Step 3: Search for Opportunities
- Can create LinkedIn Job alerts to notify you of new opportunities to check out
	1. Search for job
	2. Create search alert
	3. Set frequency
- Can indicate that you are open to opportunities and the jobs you’re considering
	- Recruiters can filter through this
- LinkedIn is a good resource for job search
	- Companies are paying to promote their jobs, and there are millions of users potentially looking for jobs, making it attractive for recruiters
- Use job filters when searching
	- Consider filtering by jobs posted in the past week (most likely to be open and available)
- Consider connecting w/ recruiters to follow up about applications, ask about position, or find other recruiters
- Can find similar jobs under full job listing for potential pivots
- In profile settings, can change job seeking preferences (under data & privacy)
	- Consider sharing profile when clicking “Apply for job” to get recruiter’s attention
	- Also can share w/ recruiters that you created job alert including their company

- Search `"I'm hiring"` in LinkedIn (maybe with a job title/keyword and/or filters) to see hiring managers that are hiring now
	- Can also switch from searching people to searching posts/content
	- Can use save search/search alerts on this too

## Step 4: Networking
- Not enough to just be good or have good positioning, *need* to network and have an insider to help give you a referral to a recruiter
- Connect by making a warm intro
	1. Do an advanced search
	2. Filter by company, role, and 2nd degree connection
	3. Visit profile and click “Mutual connections”
	4. Reach out to mutual connection and see if they can help you connect to the 2nd degree connection (as opposed to you just cold connecting with that person)

```ad-note
title: Warm Networking Example
collapse: closed

> Hi MUTUAL, would you mind introducing me to 2ND DEGREE? I'm thinking about applying jobs in his field but want to make sure it's a good fit. If you're willing to do so, I've included a message below that you can just forward over. Thank you!
> 
> Message to Forward:
> > Hi Daniel,  
> >  
> > I recently came across your profile on LinkedIn and was so fascinated by all the awesome things you’ve done. In particular, I’d love to learn about your experience with product marketing, as I’m considering that field myself.  
> >   
> > That said, I know you must be incredibly busy right now. But if you have even 10 minutes to chat in the next few weeks, just let me know as I’d love to learn from your expertise!  
> >    
> > Thanks for considering!!!

```

```ad-example
title: 2nd Degree Conversation Points Examples
collapse: closed

- It's great to connect with you via NAME - thanks for making the time!
- I'd love to learn about your experience at COMPANY. What led you to work there?
- What's kept you there over time?
- What's it like on the inside - and specifically as a ROLE?
- Thanks so much for sharing that insider perspective! It honestly sounds like a perfect fit for the kind of work I want to do - and the kind that I'm good at. Knowing that referrals are often the best way in, would you ever be open to putting one in for me? No worries if not!

```

- If you don’t have 2nd degree connections, consider reaching out to your school’s alumni who work at company you want to work for
	- On LinkedIn:
		1. Search company and job title
		2. Filter by school
		3. Find people to connect with (refer to [[Land the Perfect Job with LinkedIn#^1d3d99|Step 1]] about connecting with people)
	- Also consider school alumni network directory or [hunter.io](https://hunter.io/email-finder) to find emails
		- [hunter.io](https://hunter.io/email-finder) can help find common company email templates to guess a person’s email (e.g., `<first_initial><last_name>@company.org`)

```ad-note

> I came across your profile and, as a fellow SCHOOL grad, I’d be thrilled to learn about your experience with ROLE.  
>   
> Any chance you have 10 minutes to chat next week? I'd love to get your advice!

Conversation Points:
- It's great to connect with you as a SCHOOL alum - thanks for making the time!
- I'd love to learn about your experience at COMPANY. What led you to work there?
- What's kept you there over time?
- What's it like on the inside - and specifically as a ROLE?
- Thanks so much for sharing that insider perspective! It honestly sounds like a perfect fit for the kind of work I want to do - and the kind that I'm good at. Knowing that referrals are often the best way in, would you ever be open to putting one in for me? No worries if not!

```

- Google Chrome has LinkedIn Sales Navigator plug-in which will compare email address in the To: field to a database of emails on LinkedIn profiles
	- Can use this to verify emails and people
- [followupthen.com](https://www.followupthen.com/) can send an email reminder to follow up with an email (you’re more likely to get a response if you follow-up at least once or twice)
	- Sign up on website, and then just add the website’s email address to BCC field based on how long you want to wait in-between emails

- Consider visiting profiles of people you want to connect with to incline them to look at your profile (LinkedIn will notify that you viewed them)
	- Make sure to configure privacy settings to not make yourself hidden
	- Can use viewing information as a way to reach out to those who viewed your profile
	- Outreach Example:
	> Thanks so much for checking out my profile! I actually have a couple of ideas to boost your company’s success that I’d love to share. Any chance you have 10 minutes free next week for a quick chat?
## Step 5: Research
- Should research to prepare for interview or even introductory meetings w/ connections/recruiters/alumni
	- Look at their profile, consider topics of recent posts/likes
	- Ask mutuals for insight
	- Look for common interests
	- See who else is on their team that you can connect with
	- Should know not only job details and skills needed, but also about the industry, company, and the person
- Can look at/follow company page, follow groups that those people follow or people in industry follow
- LinkedIn’s Elevate feature can provide a feed of industry updates, thoughts from leaders, and related news
	- Based on your network
- LinkedIn also has [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/), where other people have slides with info about different companies

- Consider going above and beyond in prep to talk to someone
	- Sample projects to show your interest, skills, and knowledge
	- Blog post on LinkedIn (rather than just sharing an update)
		- Can talk about trends, or what companies should be looking at
		- Can create a SlideShare
		- Can embed these on profile

- Search for popular posts using job titles and key words and follow people with popular posts (probably well known or accomplished in the industry); learn from them and the lingo used
- LinkedIn Groups may be helpful especially when pivoting jobs
	- can learn about things like issues and strategies of the field and connect with people in that group
- There are also courses on LinkedIn if you want to learn more about a field, etc.
- LinkedIn Jobs tab also has interview prep feature which provides common questions by industry and answer examples
- Can look up salaries by location on LinkedIn, but should double check with GlassDoor
- Consider connecting with previous employees (can filter by past companies), might want to get more insight of work culture within specific team at company

## Additional LinkedIn Features/Tricks

- Economic Graph
	- See [skill trends](https://linkedin.github.io/future-of-skills/) by industry and location
	- Can use this to ID skills to have for a career and to find future positions that have skill overlaps
- LinkedIn Learning Courses
	- [10 jobs with most openings and growth](https://opportunity.linkedin.com/skills-for-in-demand-jobs)
- Turn on OpenToWork Badge
- Look for people with Actively Recruiting tag
- Make your LinkedIn page available in another language if multi-lingual/looking at other countries

```ad-faq
title: Is LinkedIn Premium worth it?
collapse: closed

Not really. If the goal is to find a job, you can talk to alumni, get found by recruiters, find jobs, get referrals, and prepare for interviews all for free. The insights and InMail features are nice, but not required to find a job.

One exception is that if you are a really active user (doing a bunch of searching), it may try to limit core search results for the month. Some workarounds include just making another account just for searching if you do hit the limit, or you can do your search on Google by using `site:linkedin.com`. You can also search using the Alumni tool on LinkedIn (these don't count towards your limit). If you really need it, you can get a one-time 30-day [free trial](http://bit.ly/lifreetrial).

```

```ad-faq
title: What should I put in the headline if changing careers?
collapse: closed

Make sure to put the title of the job you want to get rather than what you are doing now because that is what will be searchable on the recruiter's end. You can put words like "aspiring", "future", "exploring", "passionate about", "seeking XXX opportunities", etc. to make it clearer that you want to get into that field.

```

```ad-faq
title: Should I post on LinkedIn?
collapse: closed

Follow the [[80/20 rule|Pareto Principle]]. Don't sink too much time on making/engaging posts. Make sure it's targeted with the right techniques and makes sense for where you are in the job search (right place, right time).

There are 3 kinds of posts:
1. Standard posts - main content on LinkedIn feed such as people announcing accomplishments, talking about trends, etc.
2. Engagement - linking and commenting on people's posts
3. Long form articles - articles writing about the industry, job searching, etc.

Standard posts may be more beneficial at the start and end of your job search. Can use it to crowdsource feedback to help you focus your search or to help you prep for an interview. Ask good questions rather than just asking for things (e.g. jobs). Use hashtags and tag people.

Engagement on posts about hiring people (can search "hiring" by content) can help get recruiters to see you and find jobs. Likes and reactions don't notify the poster, they're mostly unnoticed. Use comments with relevant information to respond to queries in posts (e.g., include an email if responding to a recruitment post)

Long form articles can help you show off your knowledge/skills during interviews and get found by recruiters as well. Quality over quantity (you can only feature 1 on your profile at a time), and make sure to promote it through posts, etc. and maybe tag people, ask for people's feedback, etc. The article should reflect knowledge of your desired position.
```

```ad-faq
title: How many connections and should I connect broadly?
collapse: closed

LinkedIn praises 500+ connections, but you may not necessarily need that much.

Ideally, you want to have many connections. More connections means you have a better chance of being within a recruiter's connection network, and have a better chance of showing up on their searches. You also have a better chance to have a stronger connection than others.

Broad connections are good (even if you connect with someone you barely have talked to or have just met in passing) because that gives more chances to learn about opportunities outside of the people you already have meaningful connections with. If these broad connections are filling up your inbox/feed, you can always just unfollow, disconnect, and/or report/block, depending on severity.

```

```ad-faq
title: Should I do XXX on my profile?
collapse: closed

Remember your goal: to be found by recruiters. You can use LinkedIn search to see what recruiters would see. Search people with positons you want and see what they have that make them the top search results. Refer to [[Land the Perfect Job with LinkedIn#^c25397|Step 2: Position Yourself]]

## Additional Job Search Tips
### Understanding the Hiring Process
- Hiring (in the US) isn’t always merit-based (i.e., based on best skills and experience); recruiters are humans and humans are flawed w/ biases
	- Recruiters are typically the initial reviewers that suggest candidates to hiring managers who will actually be deciding and working with the candidate
	- Because of time pressure and needing to comb through many resumes, recruiters typically pick people who are:
		- Obvious that they are a great fit for the position
			- Put your desired position first in your headline
		- Eager to work there
			- Set your LinkedIn profile as “open to new opportunities”
			- Have LinkedIn company connections
			- Engage with brand on LinkedIn (e.g. follow companies)
		- Validated by internal sources
			- Can filter job search results to specifically in your network to help you find insiders for internal referrals
	- Hiring managers will want people who are:
		- Proven to be competent (so they’re not just hoping that the person can do the job)
			- Tie your experience to exactly what they need (refer to job description)
		- Ready to hit the ground running (so they don’t have to waste time extensively training the person)
			- Provide a clear plan for day 1 instead of just saying you’re excited for the interview
		- Hungry for the role (so they don’t waste time keeping the person motivated)
			- Reach out to hiring managers; many people won’t do this
```ad-note
title: Example Message to Hiring Manager
collapse: closed

You can try looking for hiring managers on LinkedIn by searching "hiring" and the job you want (and using `title:`). People tend to put this on their profiles now. Make sure to hit all three things a hiring manager wants. Here's an example message:

> Dear Diya,
> 
> 
> Just saw the you’re hiring for a PM and wanted to reach out because:
> 
> 1. My background is tightly aligned with your job description - e.g., I helped Flipkart align its payment platform with 100+ regulations. 
> 2. Having used Airbnb quite a bit, I actually have a couple of ideas for how you can quickly enhance the compliance of your payment platform.
> 
> 
> Any chance you’d be open for a quick chat next week? I’d love to share my ideas and see if I can be helpful to your team’s mission…

```

### Diversifying and Looking Abroad
- Diversify your job search and look in other countries
	- If you’re multi-lingual, you can make a separate LinkedIn page in that specific language (and even make it different if you’re looking at different roles in specific countries)
- If visa sponsorship is needed, see if there is a resource that shows companies that have (recently) sponsored people
	- For international students wanting to work in the US: [myvisajobs.com](https://www.myvisajobs.com/)
- Consider searching people who have gone to the same school as you, has the job title you want, is working in the location you would like to work in, and even have the same background as you (ethnicity, etc.)
	- Ask these people how they were able to get to where they are now, including visa process, etc.
	- Their companies are also more likely to offer sponsorships

### AI Tools/ChatGPT
- Use ChatGPT or other AI tools to help you get started writing if you’re stuck or for templates as examples but it is not good for just straight copy and pasting; you need to personalize it and it won’t give personalized advice
	- Make sure to format prompts right, feed it the right information, and tell it to adjust as needed
	- Watch out for accuracy issues and biases and the confidentiality of your data
	- ChatGPT is easy, Google Bard and MS Copilot is good for up-to-date data, Perplexity is good for citations, and Claude is good for data analysis
	- ChatGPT can help you find the perfect career based on interests and background, can help you learn what skills you need to gain, and can tell you where you can broadly work/apply
	- Can help with getting examples/templates for resume and cover letters for specific jobs or getting feedback on one you have
	- Can help with providing feedback on LinkedIn profile
	- Can help prep for interviews, salary negotiation, and post-interview thank you letters

```

### ["Making an amazing (tech) resume"](https://www.breakinto.tech/how-to-make-an-amazing-tech-resume)
- Make resume focused on one kind of job (use multiple resumes if applying to different kinds of jobs)
- Apply for the right role with the right skills
- Use the right keywords (typically from job description, especially to get past ATS)
- Recruiters take 5-10 seconds to scan resume
	- Include impressive brands, big numbers, and accolades
	- Make the resume relevant for the position you want to apply for
	- Make resume understandable for a recruiter; make jobs titles relevant if arbitrary, etc.
	- 475-600 words is ideal (600+ is ~50% less hirable)
		- Only highlights, 1-5 bullets per experience, save details for the interview and focus on facts
		- Ditch jargon

### ["Writing the perfect cover letter"](https://www.breakinto.tech/blog/2015/12/14/the-complete-step-by-step-guide-to-the-perfect-cover-letter)
- Don’t make one if they aren’t accepted or if they won’t actually be read; it’s a waste of time
	- If it’s unclear, ask someone you know in the company or ask a recruiter/hiring manager directly
	- If you are really passionate about the position and have not gotten an answer, just submit one
- Cover letters if accepted/read, can make a difference, but make it good
- Person reading the cover letter could be a recruiter or the hiring manager, but it doesn’t matter, in general just make the letter stand out
	- Readers are in a hurry but also cautious in picking people to interview
	- People will probably submit a generic letter and/or fail to demonstrate qualifications
- Cover letters are companions to a resume which only give a short 1-page summary
	- Letters help distinguish good candidates and committed job-seekers
	- It gives better feel of the candidate as a person, can signal passion for the job, and help readers choose due to unique responses beyond resume
	- Content is more important than design (depending on desired industry)
- Actually writing it:
	- Keep it to 1 page
	- Avoid writing an out-of-town address, use the place you plan to move to or don’t include one at all
		- Can be a deal-breaker if companies realize they need to fly you in
	- Use professional email, but not your current work email
	- Combine contact info (email/phone) on 1 line and don’t include the company’s address (unless they’re very traditional)
		- Line count and reading speed matters
	- Try to address it to a name rather than a generic opening and address them formally (e.g. Ms. Doe)
		- Can ask someone you know that works at the company to find the recruiter/hiring manager for the role, can find it online, or can ask the company directly about getting in touch/who is in charge of the hiring team
		- If you can’t find it, you can fall back to “Dear Hiring Manager,”
	- Goals: get readers attention, get them to like you, convince them you can do the job
		- Consider starting with a surprising fact (e.g., how the company has made a difference for you, why the job excites you); something unique about you and drawing a natural connection to the company
		- Consider having humility, include how you would fit in that particular work culture, and add a testimonial
		- Consider adding a 2-column table pairing some of the key job requirements to your qualifications
			- For your qualifications, you can try using unique stories, quantifying it, and/or showing the impact of your work
	- Set the stage for a follow-up for an interview; consider getting insider contacts to advocate and follow-up for you
